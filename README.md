### ðŸ‘‹ Hey! I'm Ben

I love building quickly, and love building in python. 

Focused on production NLP use-cases right now and always following the MLOps landscape

* Living in Boston, let's grab a drink!
* Leading an LLM team at [EvolutionIQ](https://evolutioniq.com/) focused on tackling big problems for injured workers.
* Host of the [mlops.community](https://home.mlops.community/public/events) virtual meetups. [Reach out on slack](https://mlops.community/join/) if you have cool stuff to show!
* Had some fun building a spacy-spans to huggingface-tokens [NER dataset converter](https://github.com/Ben-Epstein/spacy-to-hf/). If you're doing NER work give it a try :)
* Working on Domain Adapted Language Models. Check out [DALM](https://github.com/arcee-ai/DALM/) to train SOTA retrievers for LLMs.
* Founding engineer at [Galileo](https://rungalileo.io). Not there anymore but they're still building great NLP tools!
* ðŸ‘€ Looking to learn Rust. If anyone wants to build and learn together please reach out
